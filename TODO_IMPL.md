What needs to be done, exactly, to implement general underconstraints,
based on thoughts in `TODO.md`.

*) Extend the state representation to include underconstraints, along
 with the substition and normal constraints.



*) Test general underconstraints, including nested underconstraints.

*) Once the general underconstraints are implemented, testing, and
 working, add engines version and parameter to control tracing, like
 with the one-shot underconstraints.
